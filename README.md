# Soar  
A proof of concept game where the player flies through a cave trying to collect the coins and not crash.  
This is a minimal viable product and as such this is only a first representation. There will need to be a code refactor, graphics imporvements etc, before I release it.

## Improvements   
- better player physics. (move acurate friction and momentum, where a steeper upward angle will increase friction and slow the speed, and pointing down will increase the speed again.   
-  player tail smoothed of, so not broken up.
- more advanced cave generation. This includes solving the scaling issue and ensuring it can't get too small.
